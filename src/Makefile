# $@ = The file name of the target of the rule.
# $< = The name of the first dependency.
# $^ = The names of all the dependencies, with spaces between them.
# $? = The names of all the dependencies that are newer than the
#      target, with spaces between them.
# $* = The stem with which an implicit rule matches. If the target is
#      'dir/a.foo.b' and the target pattern is 'a.%.b' then the stem
#      is 'dir/foo'. The stem is useful for constructing names of
#      related files.

# About this makefile:
#
# This (GNU) makefile uses the builtin rules as much as possible. The
# header dependencies for individual objects are generated by $(CC),
# this means that currently GCC is expected. (Or any other compiler
# with the same behaviour for the particular command line switches.)
