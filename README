1. What is Elbow?
-----------------
Elbow is a serial communication client aimed towards embedded
programming language REPLs.

What this means is that elbow can connect to a serial device, and
send and receive data to/from it. It is aimed towards embedded
virtual machines such as armpit scheme (which can be found at
http://armpit.sourceforge.net/).

2. Usage.
---------
2.1 Starting up.
----------------
elbow --help should tell you everything about the elbow options.
The list shown by the help function will always be up to date, whereas
this readme might limp a little bit behind.

Currently elbow supports configuring the following properties through
commandline options (default in brackets):
	- baudrate (9600);
	- device to connect to (/dev/ttyUSB0);
	- end of line character to use (carriage return);
	- file to send before interactive shell starts ();
	- send STX/ETX character to mark start and end of a file transfer
	  (disabled).

The default settings should work for an armpit scheme target.

The other switches are for:
  - help (-?, --help);
	- usage (--usage);
	- version and copyright information (-v, --version).

2.2 Line by line communication.
-------------------------------
Once elbow is properly started up, you are greeted by a welcome
message, followd with a GNU Readline prompt. This gives you a command
line interface similar to that of the bash shell. Features include
but are not limited to history and reverse-i-search.
(See man 3 readline for a lot more information).

Lines are not sent until you hit return, enabling line editing.

2.3 Shutting down.
------------------
Pressing ctrl+d will exit elbow (as will ctrl+c in a more brutal
fashion ;-)).
